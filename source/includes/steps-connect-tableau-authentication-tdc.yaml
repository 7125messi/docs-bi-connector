  The :abbr:`TDC (Tableau Datasource Connection)` file is a convenient
  way to enable the cleartext plugin and specify all of
  :program:`mongosqld`'s :abbr:`TLS (Transport Security
  Layer)`/:abbr:`SSL (Secure Sockets Layer)` certificates and keys.

  To create a :abbr:`TDC (Tableau Datasource Connection)` file that can
  connect to the |bi| with authentication over :abbr:`TLS (Transport
  Security Layer)`/:abbr:`SSL (Secure Sockets Layer)`, modify the
  following ``.tdc`` file template. Substitute ``SSLKEY``, ``SSLCERT``,
  and ``SSLCA`` appropriately:

  .. class:: copyable-code
  .. literalinclude:: /includes/tdc/mysql-ssl.tdc
     :language: xml
     :emphasize-lines: 6-12
     :linenos:

  Save this file as ``mysql.tdc`` in the :guilabel:`My Tableau
  Repository` for your platform:

  .. include:: /includes/list-tables/tableau-default-tdc-locations.rst

  .. include:: /includes/facts/tableau-restart.rst

  Tableau applies the :abbr:`TLS (Transport Security Layer)`/:abbr:`SSL
  (Secure Sockets Layer)`, certificate, and cleartext plugin settings in
  the ``.tdc`` file to *every* connection matching the named database
  vendor and driver.
